# Jakey Breakout

## Main Menu Screen

Here’s what the application looks like when first opened. When pressing any key the user is taken to the main game screen, and then the game begins. They can also click on the respective text for the same effect.

## Gameplay - No Blocks Damaged

This mockup shows the screen immediately after gameplay starts, not having any blocks broken. The user starts out with 3 lives and begins on level 1, which are represented respectfully at the top left and top right. The user’s level increases by one whenever they clear all of the blocks on screen, with the ball getting faster with each increasing round. The user’s score, which is represented by the top number, increases when a block is destroyed. Blocks are destroyed after being hit 3 times. I chose not to have the words “Score” like the other indicators because it quickly becomes obvious once the player breaks a brick; it lessens redundancy.

## Gameplay - with Blocks Damaged

This is an example of gameplay after an extended amount of time, with the user racking up 8 points. When a block has been hit once it changes from yellow to orange. When hit again it turns red, and then disappearing after a third. Whenever the user clears all of the blocks, they advance to the next level, increasing the ball speed as well as giving them an additional life.
In this example the user has previously lost 1 life, showing the UI after this change.

## Game Over Screen

After losing their 3 lives, the user is shown this game over screen. If they press any key on the keyboard it restarts the game from the beginning. The same effect occurs when clicking on the respective text. 
When clicking “click here for main menu” it simply takes them back to the main menu screen.

## Possible Changes
The sizes of anything on screen are subject to change slightly. I may add rows and columns to the bricks up top, but the orientation and general layout should be exactly as represented. 
The same effect will be present on the game over screen. I'm not sure if I like the squares on the main menu, but if I add them then I'll probably animate them.
